PERFORMANCE
    posh-dynargs piggybacks on top of the PowerShell prompt. Every time prompt
    is invoked, Register-LocalArgumentCompleters is also invoked.

    Register-LocalArgumentCompleters will process .argument-completer-registry
    if it exists. This involves registering each argument completer and creating
    a helper function. If you experience a slowdown, it will be here. Once
    registered, the process will not repeat until the directory changes.

    To enable timing of the Register-LocalArgumentCompleters function, set
    $PoshDynargsSettings.EnableTiming = $true
